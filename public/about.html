<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fledgling developer.  I have been coding since high school with Microsoft Visual Basic, but did not start getting serious with coding until around late 2020.  I have been in the accounting field since 2013, but am looking to make a career change.  
</p>
<p>Software Engineering and Development has always been a huge interest for me.  Reading and writing code was something I enjoyed, yet did not feel was something I could do for a living.  Thus it remained a hobby.  </p>
